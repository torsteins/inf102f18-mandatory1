# Mandatory 1:  Solution
Here is a sample solution to this exercise.
The exercise itself is [here](https://github.com/torsteins/inf102f18-mandatory1/tree/master) (on the master branch).

The solution consists of two main parts:
 * Textual solutions in a in the main directory ([vag002.pdf](vag002.pdf))
 * Coded solutions in the directory [src/main/java/no/uib/ii/inf102/f18/mandatory1](src/main/java/no/uib/ii/inf102/f18/mandatory1)

The test cases used to autograde the assignment are the ones starting with `Grade` here (in some cases, manually applied):
 * [src/test/java/no/uib/ii/inf102/f18/mandatory1](src/test/java/no/uib/ii/inf102/f18/mandatory1)
